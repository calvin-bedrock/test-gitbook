# âœ¨ uniETH

{% hint style="info" %}
uniETH represents the staked ETH plus all future staking rewards. uniETH does not grow in quantity over time but instead, grows in value, i.e. 1 uniETH becomes worth increasingly more than 1 ETH.
{% endhint %}

Bedrock on Ethereum removes **several drawbacks** associated with Proof of Stake on Ethereum:

* While Ethereum requires a minimum stake of at least 32 ETH,&#x20;
  * [x] Bedrock on Ethereum allows anyone to earn staking rewards on any amount of ETH deposited with us,&#x20;
  * [x] In addition to receiving rewards from [EigenLayer and Bedrock points](../../bedrock-lrt/restaking-rewards.md).
* When staking on Ethereum, users need technical knowledge to interact with smart contracts.
  * [x] Bedrock handles all interactions with the blockchain on behalf of our users.&#x20;
* Ethereum also requires users who make deposits to be technically proficient in running Ethereum nodes 24/7 while keeping the node online and secure.&#x20;
  * [x] Bedrock provides this service on behalf of our users.
