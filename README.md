# ðŸ‘‹ Introducing Bedrock

Bedrock is a **multiple asset liquid restaking** protocol, that backed by non-custodial solution designed in partnership with RockX, a longstanding blockchain infrastructure company with strong roots in crypto staking.&#x20;

Bedrock support multiple assets to do both restaking / staking including:

* [brBTC](multi-asset-liquid-staking/brbtc/): brBTC standing for Bedrock BTC, is designed specifically for Bitcoin holders seeking to participate in the next generation of DeFi opportunities. It accepts uniBTC and multiple wrapped BTC assets and Bedrock manages those assets on multiple trusted yield source layers such as Babylon, Kernel, Pell, Satlayer and etc.&#x20;
* [uniBTC](multi-asset-liquid-staking/unibtc/): A restaking protocol that accept wrapped BTC tokens partnership with the BTC staking protocol [Babylon](https://babylonchain.io/learn#btc-staking) chain, the first supported wrapped BTC is wBTC token on Ethereum blockchain, so all the wBTC token holders will enjoy both yield on staking BTC tokens plus the security of Ethereum network.
* [uniETH](multi-asset-liquid-staking/unieth/): Designed to **natively restake** and harness additional EigenLayer rewards, Bedrock brings together **institutional-grade** security and additional yield to liquid staking ETH.
* [uniIOTX](multi-asset-liquid-staking/uniiotx/): The liquid staking solution on IoTeX blockchain removes several drawbacks that exist with Delegated Proof of Stake on IOTX.&#x20;

## What Does Bedrock Offer?

Bedrock offers a suite of products that include [**Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT)**](bedrock-lrt/introduction/) for Wrapped BTC tokens & ETH & IOTX, etc.

Bedrock utilizes its universal (uni) standard to unlock liquidity and maximum value in PoS tokens, such as wBTC & ETH & IOTX, with existing liquid staking tokens called uniBTC & uniETH & uniIOTX respectively.&#x20;

Bedrockâ€™s universal token model represents:

* The staked PoS tokens in Bedrock&#x20;
* All **future staking rewards** from staking on-chain
* Babylon & EigenLayer & [Bedrock Diamond Points](bedrock-lrt/bedrock-diamonds.md)
* uniToken is **non-rebasing**&#x20;

> Non-rebasing token model, means that it does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. This means that 1 uniETH/uniIOTX becomes worth increasingly more than 1 ETH/IOTX over time, in addition to points accrued from EigenLayer and Bedrock
