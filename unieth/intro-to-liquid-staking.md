# ðŸ’¡ Intro to Liquid Staking

Before introducing uniETH, it would be fitting to introduce what liquid staking is.&#x20;

PoS chains will be an integral part of the future of crypto, and become the foundation layer of which DeFi and metaverses will be built on.

However, PoS comes with some drawbacks for those wanting to participate directly as validators:

1. It requires technical know-how to set up and operate
2. 32ETH is a significant barrier for regular token holders to participate in POS validation
3. Staked tokens are locked up and become illiquid assets

To solve these issues, liquid staking protocols were born. Liquid staking abstracts the staking of tokens from running a validator node.

In exchange for their tokens, depositors receive a representative (which in our case would be uniETH) token from the protocol which is a claim on the tokens they have staked.
