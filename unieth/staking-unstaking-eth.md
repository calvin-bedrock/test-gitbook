# ðŸª™ Staking/Unstaking ETH

To stake your ETH for uniETH, click 'Connect Wallet' at the top of the page to link your MetaMask to the dApp. Once connected, the mint/withdraw function for uniETH will be available.

Bedrock allows everyone the opportunity to earn rewards on any amount up to 32 ETH, as we do not have a minimum amount required to use the Bedrock protocol. We do recommend a deposit of at least 0.01ETH to make your transaction worthwhile. When you stake ETH, you will receive uniETH, which accumulates rewards over time based on the performance of our validator nodes on Ethereum.

To be able to view your uniETH on your Metamask wallet, click 'Add to MetaMask' to import the uniETH token to MetaMask.&#x20;

The time it takes to unstake uniETH is largely dependent on the Ethereum blockchain and EigenLayer. There will be a waiting time for validators to access the ETH they wish to unstake, as there is only a single queue for both full and partial withdrawals on the blockchain. However, you will receive uniETH when you deposit it and it will accrue staking rewards over time by growing in token value. uniETH can also be sold and traded on various DEXs and CEXs if there is liquidity available for the trade and can also be used to provide liquidity to earn additional yield.
