Ethereum holders will enjoy sustainable and an increasing variety of yield opportunities by simply safeguarding the Ethereum network as well as the increasing yield enabled by restaking.&#x20;

Therefore, we will start to first enable a secure LRT protocol that supports native restaking known as uniETH (the red boxes). ETH are natively staked and restaked via Eigenpod (where we treated it as an external manager where Eigenpod address is controlled by the bedrock staking contract). In order to be future proof, this design also enables contract upgrade to accommodate the future restaking delegation. By having a modular design, it allows us to carry out the best strategies on operator delegation and AVS selection (it is equivalent to choose the best yield opportunity across AVS and choose the best validator sets). With our over three years of ETH native staking experience and the battle tested contract for Bedrock. It provides the best security and experience to the users.

Once the cap on liquid restaking is lifted, we will enable a vault which accepts ETH as well as other LSTs and deploy them through Eigenlayer on the respective routes and leverage the restaking delegation module for additional yield. Therefore, Bedrock protocol becomes a one-stop solution for ETH holders to generate long term yield.

uniETH is upgraded from a LST to LRT after one year and continuously providing high yield to uniETH holders
