# ðŸ“ƒ Introduction

uniIOTX represents the staked IOTX plus all future staking rewards. uniIOTX does not grow in quantity over time but instead, grows in value, i.e. 1 uniIOTX becomes worth increasingly more than 1 IOTX over time.

The rewards come from three components: block reward, foundation reward, and epoch reward.
