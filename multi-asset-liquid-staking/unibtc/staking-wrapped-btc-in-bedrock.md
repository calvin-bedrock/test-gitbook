You will receive uniBTC when you deposit it and it will accrue staking rewards over time by growing in token value. uniBTC can also be sold and traded on various DEXs and CEXs if there is liquidity available for the trade and can also be used to provide liquidity to earn additional yield.

Bedrock allows everyone the opportunity to earn rewards on any amount as we do not have a minimum amount required to use the Bedrock protocol. We do recommend a deposit of at least 0.005 wBTC to make your transaction worthwhile. When you stake wBTC, you will receive uniBTC, which represents staked wBTC.



4. (Optional) Add uniBTC token into your Metamask wallet

To be able to view your uniBTC on your Metamask wallet, click 'Add to MetaMask' to import the uniBTC token to MetaMask.&#x20;
