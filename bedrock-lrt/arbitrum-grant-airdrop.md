# ðŸ’¸ Arbitrum Grant Airdrop

$uniETH has officially launched on Arbitrum, and with our LTIPP Grant activated, we're super stoked to get started integrating with various DeFi protocols on Arbitrum too! Bedrock is excited to share that we've passed the [LTIPP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223/36) proposal and are receiving grant support from[@arbitrum](https://x.com/arbitrum) which will go 100% to the community!

Bedrock will start a 3 months long campaign and airdrop all **262K $ARB** tokens to eligible uniETH holders! Simply hold uniETH on Arbitrum to earn $ARB, $EIGEN and Bedrock Diamonds (up to 4x Diamonds Boost)!
