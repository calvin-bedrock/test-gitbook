There are two stages to restaking

* Staking on Ethereum
  * This is the existing core module of Bedrock, the staking function to secure Ethereum blockchain and earn rewards, for details, please refer to [uniETH](../../../multi-asset-liquid-staking/unieth/)
* Delegating to operators
  * EigenLayer makes [native restaking](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/native-restaking/) possible on Ethereum by intercepting stake before it is passed on to restakers’ withdrawal address
  * Today, users can engage in the first step of restaking – staking on the base layer of Ethereum; delegating to operators on mainnet [will be coming soon](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].



[^1]: Bedrock team work closed with EigenLayer to run EigenDA operator in Goerli testnet at the moment. Stay tuned to get latest update from Bedrock social announcement.
