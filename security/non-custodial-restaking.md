# üîè Non-Custodial Restaking

1. Eigenpod (withdrawal credential) is controlled by a smart contract

To ensure the best security standard, Bedrock will deploy a new smart contract (The EigenPod Manager) to manage the EigenPod, this smart contract will be audited by multiple security firms and open sourced as transparent as always. This will ultimately eliminate the concern of centralization or any other potential risks exposed to uniETH holders.&#x20;

2. Upgradability to be compatible with Eigenlayer

As we all know, Eigenlayer is evolving quickly. To integrate with Eigenlayer, we have to ensure flexibility with all the potential changes on top of security. This would serve the best interest of uniETH holders such as whenever a new AVS service provider / operator come onboard, Bedrock is capable of optimising our restaking strategies for a better yield, without uniETH holders involvement

Any changes in the smart contract will be well **tested and audited the same as a new contract**
