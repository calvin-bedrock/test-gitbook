# âœ¨ Bedrock's uniIOTX

Bedrock on IoTeX blockchain removes several drawbacks that exist with Delegated Proof of Stake on IOTX. We handle all interaction with the IoTeX blockchain in your place. With Bedrock on IoTeX, you instantly get uniIOTX when depositing. It can be traded, sold or held at any time, which provides our users with liquidity on their staked IOTX.



In addition, Bedrock has no minimum deposit requirement, allowing everyone to earn rewards on IOTX. There is also no maximum deposit amount for IOTX, but we will perform compliance checks on sanctioned addresses to ensure that sanctioned wallet addresses do not participate in the Bedrock protocol.



As uniIOTX is built on-chain, and all contracts are open-source and available for anyone to view, the total supply of uniIOTX can be checked and verified via this contract address:&#x20;
