# üèõÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

## Bedrock

* Bedrock is a non-custodial solution designed in partnership with RockX, a longstanding blockchain infrastructure company with strong roots in crypto staking. Designed with institutions in mind, Bedrock is a platform focused on security, compliance, and transparency.
* The Bedrock protocol is evolving to a Liquid Restaking system thanks to the EigenLayer protocol&#x20;
* In the near future, Bedrock will be able to accept variant Liquid Staking Tokens in the market and help the LST holders to earn extra yields without compromising the fund security.

## EigenPod Manager

* EigenPod Manager is a smart contract that securely manages eigenpod contract automatically, it enables all the asset management like deposit, stake, unstake, rewards allocation etc.

## Validator Cluster

* The institutional-grade validator cluster is a sophisticated module to manage Ethereum validators to secure Ethereum blockchain network and earn staking rewards. It‚Äôs the barebone of Bedrock system with tracked record since it‚Äôs launch in early 2023

## Restaking Delegation Module

* This module is still under development, and it depends on the AVS module readiness of EigenLayer protocol
* This module aims to optimise the strategies dynamically and maximise the yields, based on the performance of multiple AVS services providers and AVS operators
