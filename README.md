# ðŸ‘‹ Introducing Bedrock

Bedrock is a non-custodial solution designed in partnership with RockX, a longstanding blockchain infrastructure company with strong roots in crypto staking. Designed to natively restake and harness additional EigenLayer rewards, Bedrock brings together institutional-grade security and additional yield to liquid staking ETH.

## What Does Bedrock Offer?

Bedrock offers a suite of products that include **liquid restaking tokens** for ETH & IOTX.

Bedrock utilizes its universal (uni) standard to unlock liquidity and maximum value in PoS tokens, such as ETH & IOTX, with existing liquid staking tokens called uniETH & uniIOTX.&#x20;

Bedrockâ€™s universal token model represents the staked PoS tokens in Bedrock plus all future staking rewards from staking on-chain and EigenLayer & Bedrock Points. For example, uniETH is non-rebasing, meaning that it does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. This means that 1 uniETH/uniIOTX becomes worth increasingly more than 1 ETH/IOTX over time, in addition to points acrrued from EigenLayer and Bedrock. LFG!\
