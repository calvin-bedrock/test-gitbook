# ðŸ’ª Restaked Points

Restaked points are a measure of your contribution to the shared security of the EigenLayer ecosystem. They represent staking participation equal to the time-integrated amount staked.

For example, a user who stakes 1 ETH for 1 hour accrues 1 restaked point.

Bedrock distributes 100% of the restaking points earned by its users' deposits

**Note**: There is, approximately, a 24-hour delay in earning EigenLayer Restaked points to account for the Ethereum nodes being spun up and provisioned. This applies both for minting and transferring uniETH.
