# ✨ Bedrock's uniETH

{% hint style="info" %}
uniETH represents the staked ETH plus all future staking rewards. uniETH does not grow in quantity over time but instead, grows in value, i.e. 1 uniETH becomes worth increasingly more than 1 ETH.
{% endhint %}

Bedrock on Ethereum removes several drawbacks that exist with Proof of Stake on Ethereum.

Ethereum requires a minimum stake of at least 32 ETH. Bedrock on Ethereum will allow anyone to earn the reward on any amount of ETH deposited with us, plus additional rewards from EigenLayer and Bedrock points.

When staking on Ethereum, users are required to have technical knowledge of interacting with smart contracts. Bedrock handles all interaction with the blockchain in our users’ place. Ethereum will also require users who make deposits to be technically proficient at running Ethereum nodes 24/7, at the same time keeping that node online and secure. Bedrock provides this service in our users’ place.

uniETH is built on-chain, and all contracts are open-source and available for anyone to view. Total supply of uniETH can be checked and verified via [https://etherscan.io/token/0xF1376bceF0f78459C0Ed0ba5ddce976F1ddF51F4](https://etherscan.io/token/0xF1376bceF0f78459C0Ed0ba5ddce976F1ddF51F4)

uniETH deposit smart contract captures all these information, which can be checked and verified via [https://etherscan.io/address/0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d)

The uniETH smart contract has been audited by Peckshield. You can find the smart contract audit report for uniETH via [PeckShield Audit Report RockX Eth Staking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bedrock-Technology/docs/main/PeckShield%20Audit%20Report%20RockX%20Eth%20Staking.pdf)
