# Intro to Liquid Restaking

Restaking, or more formally the rehypothecation of assets securing a network, has recently seen an explosion of interest as stakers rush to generate additional yield on top of their existing PoS staking returns. Introduced by [EigenLayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) on Ethereum, restaking tokens have seen their [cumulative market cap balloon to over US$4B](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/liquid-restaking-tokens)n in less than a year. **By taking on incremental slashing conditions on their staked assets, users can generate increased yield through restaking** in this rapidly growing market.

Bedrock aims to provide users with more options and opportunities to earn additional yields. After the successful launch of uniETH, a Liquid Restaking Token with EigenLayer on the Ethereum network in February 2024, we are now introducing the first Liquid Restaking Token with Babylon!

Let's dive into the world of LRTs.&#x20;
